## QUADRATURE PHASE SHIFT KEYING
This repository consists of MATLAB script and simulink model is designed to facilitate communication through Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) signals, covering both the modulation and demodulation procedures. To increase realism, the system incorporates white Gaussian noise. In parallel, a Multisim simulation of QPSK has been developed, providing a circuit-level perspective on the communication system.
